# Testing & Debugging
- End-to-end tests for Cascade are in tests/e2e/cascade_tests.
- Mock API responses for local testing are in tests/mocks/api_mocks.py.
- Debugging scripts are located in scripts/debugging_tools.

# General Code Style & Formatting
- Follow the Airbnb Style Guide for code formatting.
- Use PascalCase for React component file names (e.g., UserCard.tsx, not user-card.tsx).
- Prefer named exports for components.

# Project Structure & Architecture
- Follow Next.js patterns and use the App Router.
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components in Next.js.

# Styling & UI
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use Shadcn UI for components.

# Data Fetching & Forms
- Use TanStack Query (react-query) for frontend data fetching.
- Use React Hook Form for form handling.
- Use Zod for validation.

# State Management & Logic
- Use React Context for state management.

# Backend & Database
Use Prisma for database access.

# General Code Style & Formatting
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring projects.

# Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

# TypeScript Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid any and enums; use explicit types and maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Enable strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.

# Syntax & Formatting
- Use the function keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

# Styling & UI
- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts.
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and useWindowDimensions.
- Use styled-components or Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Implement dark mode support using Expo's useColorScheme.
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Use react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations and gestures.

# General Code Style & Formatting
- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
- Avoid using any.
- Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

# Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.

# Functions & Logic
- Keep functions short and single-purpose (<20 lines).
- Avoid deeply nested blocks by:
- Using early returns.
- Extracting logic into utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce) to simplify logic.
- Use arrow functions for simple cases (<3 instructions), named functions otherwise.
- Use default parameter values instead of null/undefined checks.
- Use RO-RO (Receive Object, Return Object) for passing and returning multiple parameters.

# Data Handling
- Avoid excessive use of primitive types; encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid placing validation inside functionsâ€”use classes with internal validation instead.
- Prefer immutability for data:
- Use readonly for immutable properties.
- Use as const for literals that never change.
